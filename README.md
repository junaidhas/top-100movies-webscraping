# top-100movies-webscraping
used BeautifulSoup library to get the html data from the top100 movies webpage by empireonline.org and getting only the movie titles from the webpage and store in a list. And to add this list in a new text file so that I can view the top 100 movies which I haven't watched and delete the movies once I watched.
